    <h4>Instructions of use:</h4>
    <br>
    <p><b>Selecting elements:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>An element can be selected by clicking directly on top of it or in it's very near vicinities. On approach of an element that can be 
        selected, a <code style="color: aqua;">blue tint</code> will appear surrounding the objected.</li>
      <li>After clicking an element that could be selected, it will change color to <code style="color: aqua;">blue</code>, indicating that it has 
        been selected.</li>
      <li>The 'clickable' elements in the diagram are the Tasks (which are represented by the boxes with activity descriptions); and the Sequence Flows
        (which are the arrows leading from and to Tasks and Gateways).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Selecting a path:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>During the selection of elements, the user will encounter 'Gateway' elements. These are some diamond shaped 'boxes' with a symbol inside 
        which have Sequence Flows leading to and from it.</li>
      <li>Gateways represent decisions in the diagram, meaning that depending on the symbol represented inside the Gateway different actions will be
        available.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exclusive Gateways</strong> are the ones represented with an 'X' inside it. In this element, it's only possible to <strong>choose one</strong> Sequence Flow 
            leading from it.</li>
          <li><strong>Inclusive Gateways</strong> are the ones represented with an 'O' inside it. In this element, it's possible to <strong>choose one or more</strong> Sequence 
            Flow's leading from it.</li>
          <li><strong>Parallel Gateways</strong> are the ones represented with an '+' inside it. In this element, it's the user has to <strong>choose every</strong> Sequence Flow
            leading from it in order to continue.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Changing the time:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>After selecting an element, the user can <strong>right click</strong> the element and the date picker side panel will appear. By default, 
        a start and completion time is generated based on the current time.</li>
      <li>To <strong>change the start and completion dates</strong>, click on the date inside the field and a calendar will appear. Changing the 
        information on this calendar updates date on the task.</li>
      <li>To <strong>change the time</strong>, click on hour, minute or second to update and use the keyboard to change the values.</li>
      <li>To close the side panel, the user can either click the 'X' located on the top-right corner of the panel or right click an empty section 
        of the diagram viewer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Element colors:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uncolored elements are the ones that either haven't been selected yet, or aren't available for selection anymore for being in optional 
        paths that are no longer accessible upon previous submissions.</li>
      <li><code style="color: aqua;">Blue</code> elements are the current elements being selected in the ongoing session, and are awaiting a possible
        submission to turn into 'history' elements and be colored <code style="color: #1CAC78;">green</code>.</li>
      <li><code style="color: #1CAC78;">Green</code> elements are the elements that were previously submitted and aren't available anymore for 
        selection. These elements show us the previous paths used in earlier sessions.</li>
      <li><code style="color: #F0E68C;">Yellow</code> elements are the elements which match the activities detected by the sensors. These elements
        have their start and completion date and time filled automatically according the sensors information, although this can still be changed
        in the date picker panel after selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Submitting a selection:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>After doing a task selection, it's possible to click the button <code style="color: #0069d9;">Submit tasks</code> to send the selected tasks 
        to the server for submission.</li>
      <li>After clicking the <code style="color: #0069d9;">Submit tasks</code> button the diagram will refresh to either account for the new elements
        submitted in that action or retrieve the new diagram if the current one has reached it's end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Downloading the Project File:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>By clicking the download button, a text file is downloaded containing some details relative of the car and all of the of the previously completed
        tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Diagram location and Zoom:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The diagram default location is generated automatically to fit the entire diagram in the viewing area. It's possible to move the diagram by simply 
        clicking and dragging within the canvas, and to zoom by simultaneously clicking 'Ctrl' key and scrolling the mouse wheel.</li>
    </ul>
