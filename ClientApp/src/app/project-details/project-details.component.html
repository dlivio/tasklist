  <h4>Instructions of use:</h4>
  <br>
  <p><b>Selecting elements:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>An element can be selected by clicking directly on top of it or in it's very near vicinities. On approach of an element that can be 
      selected, a <code style="color: aqua;">blue tint</code> will appear surrounding the objected.</li>
    <li>After clicking an element that could be selected, it will change color to <code style="color: aqua;">blue</code>, indicating that it has 
      been selected.</li>
    <li>The 'clickable' elements in the diagram are the Tasks (which are represented by the boxes with activity descriptions); and the Sequence Flows
      (which are the arrows leading from and to Tasks and Gateways).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Selecting a path:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>During the selection of elements, the user will encounter 'Gateway' elements. These are some diamond shaped 'boxes' with a symbol inside 
      which have Sequence Flows leading to and from it.</li>
    <li>Gateways represent decisions in the diagram, meaning that depending on the symbol represented inside the Gateway different actions will be
      available.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusive Gateways</strong> are the ones represented with an 'X' inside it. In this element, it's only possible to choose one Sequence Flow 
          leading from it.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Gateways</strong> are the ones represented with an 'O' inside it. In this element, it's possible to choose one or more Sequence 
          Flow's leading from it.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Gateways</strong> are the ones represented with an '+' inside it. In this element, it's the user has to choose every Sequence Flow
          leading from it in order to continue.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Element colors:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uncolored elements are the ones that either haven't been selected yet, or aren't available for selection anymore for being in optional 
      paths that are no longer accessible upon previous submissions.</li>
    <li><code style="color: aqua;">Blue</code> elements are the current elements being selected in the ongoing session, and are awaiting a possible
      submission to turn into 'history' elements and be colored <code style="color: #1CAC78;">green</code>.</li>
    <li><code style="color: #1CAC78;">Green</code> elements are the elements that were previously submitted and aren't available anymore for 
      selection. These elements show us the previous paths used in earlier sessions.<code style="color: #1CAC78;">green</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Submitting a selection:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>After doing a task selection, it's possible to click the button <code style="color: #0069d9;">Submit tasks</code> to send the selected tasks 
      to the server for submission.</li>
    <li>After clicking the <code style="color: #0069d9;">Submit tasks</code> button the diagram will refresh to either account for the new elements
      submitted in that action or retrieve the new diagram if the current one has reached it's end.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Downloading the Project File:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>By clicking the download button, a text file is downloaded containing some details relative of the car and all of the of the previously completed
      tasks.
    </li>
  </ul>
